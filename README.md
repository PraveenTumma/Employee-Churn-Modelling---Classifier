# Employee-Churn-Modelling---Classifier

# Problem Statement: 
  An Organisation has high Attrition rate and decided to tackle it by understanding what factors are causing the employees to leave the company. It created a dataset with different factors effecting the employee and observed them over few months and collated who left and who did not during that period. Now we need to uncover insights and provide them to business suggesting which factors are most influential for an employee to leave and also predict who may leave the company in coming days or months.
